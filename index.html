        <p class="bio">Hello, my name is Harrison Palmer and well…I’m now a coding bootcamp student. Now thats not how I usually define
            myself but over the next 6 months this will be my life. I am born and raised in Austin, TX and attended Texas
            State University. I currently work for the American Cancer Society as a Cancer Resource Specialist. The job has
            its ups and downs but even getting to make a small impact on someones life can be very rewarding. I enjoy playing
            video games, going for a rune, playing music and simply just hanging out with friends.
        </p>


        <p class="bio">I like to travel but I have not done very much of that but hopefully that changes in the future. I also enjoy reading
            historical non-fiction books, anything related to history really. Whenever I do get to travel I really want to
            make the trip to Europe. There are so many castles there and castles have fascinated me since I was young. And
            in Europe there are just a lot of old cities and interesting architecture. I also would like to travel to South
            America to see the rainforest. The rainforest seems so magical when I have learned about it in school and is
            a place like no other on earth. The last place that I have a real desire to travel is Africa. Africa seems very
            mysterious simply because the continent is so large. I feel like one could spend a lifetime exploring Africa
            and could still not explore it all!</p>
